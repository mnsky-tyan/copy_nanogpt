# copy_nano

A learning-focused project inspired by and initially copied from [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) by Andrej Karpathy.

This repo is **for my own learning purposes**. I added comments and made incremental changes while experimenting with ideas and techniques beyond the original GPT‑2-style baseline.

## Credits / Inspiration

- Original inspiration and starting point: **NanoGPT** by Andrej Karpathy  

I’m grateful to Karpathy for making NanoGPT available and easy to learn from.

## What this repo is

- A personal fork / study implementation based on NanoGPT
- Extra comments and small refactors to improve readability
- Experimental improvements (newer techniques compared to GPT‑2 baseline), as I learn

## What this repo is not

- Not an official NanoGPT fork

- Not intended as a drop-in replacement for NanoGPT
